    <p>To fly a bird needs not only wings but also the open sky Yes, friends, I was born in a very simple family from
      Dafi, Kashi. We were struggling to make ends meet and come out of the clutches of poverty.Starting from
      door-to-door tutoring then going on to stabilising five different businesses namely coaching institute, supply of
      construction materials, cloth shop, travel agency, and telecommunication. At the age of 22, my monthly income was
      already in six figures and that’s when Modicare came into my life. This business turned my life around completely
      but yes, it was not that easy. Before things can change for the better, we have to first change ourselves, which
      is always painful and very difficult to do. Today I am living such a wonderful life that I never even dreamt of.
      Absolutely pure, working for the good of the people from morning till evening and rising above caste, religion and
      creed. Working with the idea of a wonderful and spiritual ‘Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah’, such a beautiful life I am
      living that it is not difficult but impossible to describe it in words. By imbibing the principle ‘Zorba, the
      Buddha’, living life with the highest energy level, a sense of public well-being and living at the climax of the
      material world, this spiritual journey has become the basis of my life. I sincerely thank the Almighty God for
      this wonderful, unimaginable and wonderful life. Today, ruling in the hearts of millions of people of India,
      touching their feelings, trying to give a beautiful turn to their lives, I feel that God should give such a life
      to everyone. I now drive in a luxury car Mercedes-Benz E class, traveled to many international countries and even
      own a farmhouse. I also, built a small residential complex and I helped many people to become rich. Also, there
      are many colleagues in my team who drive their own Mercedes. I heartily thank Shri Samir Kumar Modi for all these
      achievements. I consider Samir Sir a messenger of God who is telling the true meaning of ‘Azadi’ to the Indian and
      helping them to achieve it. I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to Modicare management and to all my
      colleagues who have been with us through thick and thin. I also want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my upline
      Shri Nagendra Pratap Singh Ji, due to whose blessings and religious deeds, we are progressing so much and moving
      forward. Lastly, I request you all that if you want to give a beautiful turn to your life then just once
      understand the principle of 'Power of Leveraging' and 'Power of Time Compounding'</p>
