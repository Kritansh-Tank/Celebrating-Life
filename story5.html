    <p>I am a graduate from Delhi University. My father made me join Modicare six years ago, while I was still in
      college. Initially I was not keen on it, but after meeting Mr. Manoj Malik, I was impressed. Rest, as they say, is
      history. My faith and confidence in Modicare grew with each passing day and with each of my achievement.
      Within a short span of time, Modicare started giving me a good regular income and made me financially secure at a
      very young age. I am proud that on silver jubilee of my parentsâ€™ anniversary in 2016, I gifted them a Vitara
      Breeza through Car Fund. I also purchased a 3 BHK apartment in Greater Faridabad worth Rs.70 lac through House
      Fund. I became the youngest to travel to Bangkok, even before my 20th birthday. Since then I have visited
      Malaysia, Turkey, Moscow, London and Dubai. There are many more trips and luxury cruises to come. My biggest
      moment was when I purchased my dream car Jaguar just before my 25th birthday,

      By reaching this level, I have proudly joined my mentors - Mr. Manoj Malik, Dr. Surekha Bhargava and Mr. Tarun
      Bajaj. I thank the entire Modicare Management and Mr. Samir Modi for providing us with such a wonderful platform
      where anybody can fulfil their dreams.Thanks to my mentors for inspiring me. Thanks to Mrs. Meenu and Tarun Bajaj
      Sir. I bow my head to my heart lines without whom nothing could have been possible. I am proud to have you all in
      my life. Thanks to my loving family too, for their love and support</p>
